Web Terminal 
===========
* This little app allows a user to browse [http://www.pawel.pw](my site), through an imitated Ubuntu like terminal.
* Live version along with usage instructions can be found at [http://terminal.pawel.pw](http://terminal.pawel.pw)
* I did this little side project to explore JavaScript a little bit.

#####Disclaimer#####
* Typing speed (in the terminal) may vary between browers due to varying usage of 'onkeypress' vs 'onkeyup' events. 
The reason for the spilt usage is the fact that not all browsers trigger 'onkeypress' event when the backspace button is pressed.
