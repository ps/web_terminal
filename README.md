Web Terminal 
===========
* This little app allows a user to browse [http://www.pawel.pw](my site), through an imitated Ubuntu like terminal.
* Live version along with usage instructions can be found at [http://terminal.pawel.pw](http://terminal.pawel.pw)
* I did this little side project to explore JavaScript a little bit.

#####Disclaimer#####
* The web terminal works best in Firefox. At the moment Chrome and IE still works but the way 
backspace is being handeled is a little peculiar. Compatibility for those browsers is coming soon.
